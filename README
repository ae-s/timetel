this takes the form of a tape loop

every recording is retained, on an infinite "tape".  each recording is
a segment in its own file.

every time it is picked up we start playing at ten minutes prior to
the end of the tape.

for each call we take the various tape segments and splice together
the most recent ten minutes.  this input tape is fed to asterisk.

the dialplan plays and records at the same time.  the input is
discarded.  the output goes to a tape segment.

at the end of a call, the new recording is indexed and stored.  then a
new input tape is prepared.
